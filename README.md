Submission

Before submitting your assignment, please create a Readme.md file in your repository to answer the following questions (submit the URL of your group's repo as your assignment):

1. Did you receive any help from others (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who.

I'm pretty sure most of us did our bits individually. Mainly looking at slack to see if there was any useful advice
or asking each other.

2. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this challenge?

Probably like 3-4 combined?
3. On a scale of 1 (too easy) to 10 (too challenging), how difficult was this challenge?

4

4. Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better?

Not sure if we ran into any problems other than deciding which chart to use.
